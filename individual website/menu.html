I am most impressed by the days I went hiking with my friend on weekend. The Kepayang Hill was first time that we visit which located not so far from our house.</h2></justify>
	<br>
	<br>
	<justify><h2>Kepayang Hill is located near the residential area, Taman Bukit Kepayang. You can park near the shop lots and walk to the hiking trails or park by the roadside near the starting point and 2.1 kilometer moderately trafficked loop trail located Seremban, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. It is also called Indian Mountain by many Seremban folks because there is an Indian temple on top of the mountain. The trail is primarily used for hiking and nature trips and is accessible year-round.</h2><justify>
	<br>
	<br>
	<justify><h2>Generally, hiking is the one of activities that most people do when their come to this hill especially chinese people. I learned something when my friend and I went hike because there are a lot of senior people no matter man or woman but their still want to stay healthy if we want to compare with young people that always hang out on Mamak restaurant to play games like PUBG.</h2><justify>

As I mentioned, the location of this place is located in Bukit Kepayang Park, Seremban 2 hence the name trail Bukit Kepayang. To be honest, I've seen this place for a long time because it looks like a temple on the hill.</h2><justify>

	<justify><h2>You will also see some monkeys 🐒 walking by and people who walks this trail are very friendly as they will greet you when they see you. If you spend time in nature, you’ve probably noticed that you feel happier out there than in here.
	*Please do not feed the monkeys (and other wild animals) because you are not doing the monkeys a favor.  In fact, you are actually harming them.</h2><justify>
	<br>
	<br>
	<justify><h2>Kepayang Hill is one of the best mountains for beginners to hike. For easy trail, it takes about 30-40 minutes to the peak of the hill. You can also challenge other trails the next time you visit Kepayang Hill. As a reminder, try to avoid the trail after rain as the dirt paths can turn into muddy sludge, making it especially dangerous if you don’t have proper footwear on.</h2><justify>

	<br>
	<justify><h2>There is an Indian temple on top the hill. The Indian Temple is usually filled with monkeys but the people in-charge of the temple places fake tigers to scare the monkeys away.</h2><justify>

here we can foster a spirit of solidarity between nations and mutual respect for each other regardless of Malays, Chinese and Indians. From the bottom to the top, I never stopped smiling at other race even though it was tiring but unity was more important than exhaustion!.</h2><justify>

Being in nature reminds me of the beauty of life and that my problems are not bigger than myself. Whenever I’m feeling overwhelmed, I find being in nature to be instantly calming and soothing. When you feel angry, lost or hurt, remove yourself from your current environment and head off for a walk. You will be surprised at how much better you feel afterwards. 🌸</h2><justify>
